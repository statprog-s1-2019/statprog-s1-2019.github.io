## Shiny

- is a framework for writing web apps in R 

- easiest way to create interactive tools using R

- can be run locally in RStudio, hosted on RStudio's shinyapps.io or your own server, or even embedded in RMarkdown documents.

## A "Fair" Coin and the Beta-Binomial model

Let's imagine a situation where I have a coin that I claim is fair, you are less certain - you can ask me to flip the coin $n$ times and we will record the number of "heads" as $x$. After this experiment what should you believe about the fairness of my coin?

<br/>

We can model this using the conjugate beta-binomial model,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi(p) &\sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta) \\
x \,|\, p &\sim \text{Binom}(p, n)\\
\end{aligned}
$$
it then follows that
$$
p\,|\,x \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha+x, \beta+N - x)
$$

## Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)

Offered without any theory or proof, consider the following algorithm:

1. Sample $m$ values from each of the given prior distribution(s), $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(m)}$.

2. For each of the $m$ draws, simulate the data from the assumed data generative process, $\boldsymbol{x}^{(m)}$.

3. If the simulated data is sufficient close to the observed data, keep $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(m)}$.

4. The distribution of the kept $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(m)}$s will approximate the posterior  distribution $\boldsymbol{\theta}|\boldsymbol{x}$.

## Beta-Binomial ABC

Our particular use case provides a straight forward application of this method,

--

1. Draw from the prior:
```r
p = rbeta(m, alpha, beta)
```

--

2. Simulate the data: 
```r
x_sim = rbinom(m, n, p)
```

--

3. Keep the matches:
```r
abc_post = p[x_sim == x]
```
